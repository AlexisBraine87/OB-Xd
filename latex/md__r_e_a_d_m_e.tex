OB-\/\+Xd is based on the \href{https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberheim_OB-X}{\texttt{ Oberheim OB-\/X}}. It attempts to recreate its sound and behavior, but as the original was very limited in some important ways a number of things were added or altered to the original design. OB-\/\+Xd was designed to sound as good and as rich as the original. It implements micro random detuning which is a big part of that sound.

While not copying originals, some of the features were taken to a better point. Continuous blendable multimode filter (HP-\/\+Notch(BP)-\/HP in 12 dB mode and 4-\/1 pole in 24 dB mode). Also, like many synths of the OB-\/X\textquotesingle{}s generation, the OB-\/\+Xd has no internal effects so its sounds and textures can be greatly enhanced by the use of additional processing like chorus, reverb, delay, etc.
